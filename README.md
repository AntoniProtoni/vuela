# “¡Vuela!” - building an open science drone toolkit

In this project we will be prototyping an open source drone toolkit that can be used for research purposes in different fields, in which this technology is already used but is dominated by closed-source tools. This project builds upon available open source hardware and software, which will be integrated in an open, iterative, and collaborative process. This project is being possible thanks to a Mozilla Science 2018 mini-grant.

We believe our equal emphasis on the who, the how and the what is the most unique and exciting aspect of this project. 

### Who

We believe people with no previous technical experience can and should work side by side with those with official training or experience. This type of collaboration has the power of furthering the goals of democratizing science and technology, but also of improving the effectiveness and impact of open technologies in society. 

Online tools and global communities are helping make open technologies more accessible, but there is still a significant barrier: English is the dominant language in global communities, limiting access in Latin America, where only a minority learns a foreign language.

The members of our ‘crew’ are hobbyists, researchers, community scientists, neighbours, students, developers, and we speak Spanish, Haitian Créole, English, French and Portuguese. We welcome and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you. We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community and adhere to the code of conduct.

### How

Local action is able to focus on context relevant problems and issues that the ‘global science’ agenda might not prioritize. Our project focuses on developing tools useful for addressing local issues, and encourages local participation by trying to lower cultural and language barriers.

Open source definitions refer to the ability to replicate, modify, adapt and redistribute, but these steps are usually taken for granted and are not particularly encouraged. With this in mind, instead of developing a tool from scratch, we started this project by replicating, testing, and identifying potential improvements for an already available open source drone called ‘Flone’ (flone.cc), in a series of open, collaborative workshops. We believe that open science needs a different kind of ‘user’ of scientific tools, one that is not only user but also a collaborator. 

Between April and July 2018 we will work towards developing this new prototype with a total of 7 local, in-person workshops, and also online using collaborative tools such as GitHub and the Open Science Framework. We will prioritize having documentation in different languages (at least English, Spanish and Haitian Créole), and in a format that is easy to modify and translate.

### What

Drones can be a powerful tool for research in disciplines such as agriculture and environmental sciences, allowing the capture of aerial imaging with great flexibility. But open science requires open instruments and materials, and drones should not be an exception. 

A number of possible improvements, modifications and additions to the original design of the ‘Flone’, necessary for using the drone for research purposes, were identified during our 2017 workshops. For a ‘typical’ use in research, a drone needs to be able to be reliably positioned over the studied terrain and capture high-quality images that can be later processed into a high-resolution, ortho-rectified mosaic image of the surveyed area. These improvements will be the subject of the project activities during 2018:

- Improving the ability of the pilot to accurately position the drone. The original ‘Flone’ is controlled using a smartphone app, which communicates with the flone via bluetooth. The range is therefore limited to about 10 meters. First, we want to increase the range by either i) an improved bluetooth antenna, ii) using a radio link, or iii) using wifi. Second, we want to add a GPS module to allow the drone to automatically lock its position.

- Improving image capture. The images captured in our first tests were not satisfactory, due to the vibration from the motors. We want to test two alternative solutions: i) reducing the vibration by adding different vibration damping materials, and ii) using an active camera stabilizing device (‘gimbal’) attached to the drone, for which there is an open-source design already available.

- Testing an image processing pipeline. We need to be able to combine several captured images into an orthorectified mosaic which can be further processed or analyzed depending on the research question (e.g. to measure vegetation or to map terrain features). We want to test the open-source OpenDroneMap software for processing the images captured with our drones.

In the final workshop in Chile the complete toolkit will be tested in one of the sites previously identified by the community: an illegal quarry in the urban hill “El Sombrero” in the city of Melipilla.
