Vuela Code of Conduct - English
We strive to make the Vuela project open to all, regardless of academic, working or professional background, identity or gender expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, age, economic origin, country of origin, language , employment, religion and other differences. Because we have different origins, it is important to have the intention of providing respectful and equitable spaces -both online and in person- to unite and engage with a constructive and respectful discourse. We have peaceful and non-harmful purposes.
 
Vuela is equitable. Equity recognizes the fact that not everyone starts from the same position and that treating everyone in the same way could maintain the disparity with which they started. For this reason, we seek to intentionally reduce the barriers to access to create, use and learn from science and technology.
 
This Code of Conduct applies to all Vuela spaces, both online and in person.
 
We take violations of the Code of Conduct very seriously. Therefore, those who violate this Code may be affected their ability to participate in Vuela. If you have any questions regarding our commitment to this Code and/or you are not sure about any aspect of it, please send an email to vuelaendron@gmail.com and we will provide clarification.
 
How does it work
 
This Code is an effort to maintain a respectful space for all and to discuss what could happen if that space were compromised. Please read the behavior guidelines of our project below and keep them in mind when participating in the activities.
We listen
 
We begin the interactions recognizing that we are part of a community with complementary objectives. We must ensure that everyone participates and shares their ideas, not just those who feel more comfortable speaking / writing and presenting their ideas or proposals. We must prevent or interrupt any attempt (conscious or unconscious) of individuals or groups to dominate the conversation, whether by personal, cultural, language, etc. characteristics.
 
This Code also applies to online spaces, in which a large number of people interact without the presence of useful visual cues. Because of this, respectful and conscientious behaviors are especially important and difficult.
 
When something happens and someone feels uncomfortable, our first option is to overcome it through dialogue. We listen to each other.
 
Some advices:
If in a meeting or online forum there are people who speak different languages, we make sure that everyone can participate in the conversation, translating the messages or using non-verbal or non-written communication methods
To listen actively we ask questions first, instead of making statements.
We give people time and space to respond.
We adjust our behavior appropriately when asked.
We know that the repetition of harmful behavior after it has been addressed is disrespectful.
We avoid this and help others identify when they are doing it.
We practice consent
 
In meetings in person, everyone's physical space must be respected at all times. We do not touch other people unless we are sure they will be comfortable with that type of contact.
Ask first.
We respect the right of everyone to walk away at any time.
If you see or experience a violation of this code, please contact one of the Vuela organizers in person or at vuelaendron@gmail.com
 
Keep in mind that many forms of harassment do not resemble physical or verbal abuse, but they still fall into this category. Non-consent may include the display of sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, online stalking, following, photography or audio or video recording without permission, sustained interruption of conversations or talks, inappropriate physical contact and unwanted sexual attention.
Examples of community behavior in person
Adequate behavior
Unsuitable behavior
Ask permission to post photos or other people's content on social networks (see Media Consent, below).
Upload on the internet photos, labels or other references without the consent of those involved.
Tell your own narrative, from your own unique experiences and culture.
To mock the cultural expressions of groups, or to dismiss the experiences of people as illegitimate or merely personal.
Use accessible language to talk about your area of ​​expertise. If others in the group seem confused, slow down and ask for feedback.
Present information in a way/language that no one else in the room can understand, without trying to include others in the discussion. Accessible language is part of Vuela's objectives.
Give everyone the opportunity to speak, only interrupting if absolutely necessary - for example, making explicit a violation of the Code of Conduct or giving time warnings.
Repeatedly interrupting a discussion.
Stop, listen and ask for clarification if someone perceives your behavior as a violation of the Code of Conduct.
Ignore others' request to stop potentially harmful behavior, even if it were an accident
Use words that accurately describe the situation instead of culturally or socially charged terms - For example, use "The wind was ridiculously strong!" Instead of "The wind was crazy!"
Use disability and mental/emotional health terminology to describe a metaphorical situation, even if it seems normal to do so.
Make sure that the other person will accept and be comfortable before touching him/her, even when it is a joke or a greeting. Hugs, cheek kisses, and handshakes are normal greetings in some cultures, but not in all of them.
Initiate physical contact without consent, even if it seems normal.
Change activity or place if someone has not invited you (and wasn’t supposed to) and is not interacting with you.
Violate personal space by continuing your physical presence in private spaces without consent.
Use a uniform tone, and lower the speed and volume of your voice when you do not agree. Keep in mind that the differences will be common, and some will be irreconcilable in a diverse context.
Commit verbal or physical abuse, annoy, yell, or intimidate any person.
Use the pronouns that people have specified for themselves.
Refusing to use correct gender pronouns.
Take a step forward and report when you see violations of this code, by email to vuelaendron@gmail.com  
Expect that people who are subject to violations of the Code of Conduct feel comfortable or able to report or deal with these abuses themselves.
 
 
Examples of online community behavior
 
 
Adequate behavior
Inappropriate behavior
Stay on topic in threads with lots of messages, so they are easier to follow.
Send unnecessary single-line responses that become "spam" for many people and lower the overall content quality of a conversation. (Exception: expressions of appreciation and encouragement)
Start a new topic if your answer starts to diverge significantly from the original topic.
Reply off topic, making it difficult for readers to follow the message chain.
Write short and literal subject lines to help list readers deal with the volume of communication.
Use humorous expressions and euphemisms in subject lines, as they are easily misunderstood, although enthusiasm is welcome!
Mind your tone. We are not having this conversation in person, so it is more important to maintain a tone of respect, kindness and cordiality.
Write in an aggressive, disrespectful or mocking tone. Note: all-caps writing is considered equivalent to shouting.
 
Media consent
If you do not want to be photographed or filmed, you are responsible for pointing it out on your identification tags and / or raising your hand to alert photographers.
If you are taking a picture, have people in the room know it. Once you have taken the pictures or videos, check your shots to make sure that none of those who did not want to be photographed are in the photos. Remove those that need to be eliminated.
Do not publish physical or electronic addresses, or telephone numbers along with the photographs.
Always check with parents about the publication of any content that includes minors, and never post the name of a minor along with their photograph.
 
How to communicate a problem
In person - Organizers: If you are at an event with a designated security officer, do not hesitate to approach them or an organizer.
By email - Organizers: If you experience or witness something , please contact the organizers by email at vuelaendron@gmail.com.

Reporting should never be done through social networks.
Consequences
Any person who is requested to stop a behavior that violates the Code of Conduct must do so immediately, even if they do not agree with the request. The organizers can take the measures they deem necessary and appropriate, including removal of the person from the activity or meeting without prior notice. The organizers reserve the right to prohibit the attendance of those who violate this code of conduct to any future meeting.
If someone violates this code in a forum or online activity, a person from the group of moderators (currently Vuela organizers)  will put that person in 'moderation' mode, suspending their publication permissions on GitHub, OSF and / or the forum in question. The contact person of the moderators group will: 1) email the person who violated the code directly with a brief explanation of what has been violated, 2) send a summary email to the rest of the group of moderators, and 3) If it had happened on a public list, notify the list that one of the members has been put into moderation, with a brief explanation of the actions that are not tolerated.
 
By participating in Vuela events and activities, both in person and online, you agree to this code of conduct.
